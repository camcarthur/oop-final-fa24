This project is an online banking website developed to handle banking operations, such as account management, 
fund transfers, and transaction history retrieval. The website features secure user login, encrypted password storage, 
and logs to track account activity. The primary objective is to create a secure/user-friendly platform where users 
can perform mock banking tasks while following security practices for the safety of sensitive information.

The development follows object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation, polymorphism, and 
inheritance. The system features a frontend application that works with a backend database to store user data, 
balances, and logs. The platform will support multiple accounts, including checking and savings accounts, 
for each user via the accounts UUID. Additional features would be encrypted login, password protection, 
and account modification, allowing users to change personal information like passwords and names.

Key features include the ability to withdraw, deposit, and wire funds between accounts, along with support for 
personal account management. The project demonstrates OOP principles in a real-world banking context, providing 
a robust design that meets course and project requirements.
